Arithmetic
Write a program to let a child practice arithmetic skills.

The program should first ask for what kind of practice is wanted: addition(1), subtraction(2), or multiplicatio(3)... (no division).

Then, the program will have a loop for each of the the desired operations that lets the user repeat the practice as many times as desired,

Two random numbers will be generated (0 - 9), and the child will have to add, subtract or multiply them.

If the child answers the question correctly, congratulate them, and give them two different numbers to try.

If the child answers incorrectly, the problem should be repeated (with the two same numbers).

Sample Run:

Would you like to add(1), subtract (2) or multiply(3): 1

What is 2 + 2 equal to: 3

That is incorrect, what is 2 + 2 equal to: 4

Correct! Would you like to try again? (1 for Yes, 2 for No): 1

What is 3 + 8 equal to: 3

That is incorrect, what is 3 + 8 equal to: 11

Correct! Would you like to try again? (1 for Yes, 2 for No): 2

Thank you for playing!
