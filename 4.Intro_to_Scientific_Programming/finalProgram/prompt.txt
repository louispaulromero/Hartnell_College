Final Program
Write a PYTHON (Version 3) program which uses functions to:
A) write 100 random numbers (100-200) into a file "finalNums.txt", numbers must be separated by a comma ","
B) read the 100 numbers from "finalNums.txt" and RETURN an INTEGER list of ONLY those numbers divisible by 7 or 4
C) show the original list from (B), sort the integer list and show sorted list. You may not use sort()
D) show the min, max, average, median and total of the list from (B), AND write them to a file "finalCalc.txt".
(You may not use any python build-in functions to calculate min, max, average)
