Prime Numbers
Write a program that finds and prints all prime numbers between 3 to 100.
A prime number is a number that can be evenly divided only by 1 and itself. 

For example 5/2 = 2.5, 5/3=1.67, 5/4=1.25. So 5 is a Prime!

For example 6/2=3.0 , remainder is Zero. So 6 is not a Prime!

Hint: One way to solve this problem is to use a doubly nested loop. 
The outer loop can iterate from 3 to 100 while the inner loop checks 
to see if the counter value for the outer loop is prime. 
One way to see if number N is prime is to loop from 2 to N-1 
and if any of these number evenly divides N, then n cannot be prime

Sample output:

The prime numbers between 3 and 100 are: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
