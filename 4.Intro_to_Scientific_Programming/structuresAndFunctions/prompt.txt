Structures and Functions
1) Write a program which uses a structure strength. Use typedef.

2) The structure has 4 float variables: d (diameter), p (load),  strain, stress.
 
3) Declare a struct variable  of the strength type inside the main (NOT global)
4) Your input (d and p) is done using a function. Pass the structure variable by pointer 
 
5) Your computations are in a funcCalc, which returns a strength  structure variable to the main.
(Compute the compression stress and the strain in the column.)
Formulas:

Area = (pi * d^2) / 4
Stress = p / area
Strain = stress / E
E = 30 x 10^6
6) Output is done in a function, pass structure variable by value 

( Output the load, diameter, stress, and strain with proper format. )
